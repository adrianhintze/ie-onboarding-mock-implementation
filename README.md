Welcome to the TC training mock environment!

Your goal will be to get into our clients shoes and get a full basic BV implementation up and running.

Before you start:

1 - Install NVM. 

Run the following in a command prompt: curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.0/install.sh | bash
Make sure the installation worked with: nvm --version
Install node with: nvm install node
Set the current node version to the one you just installed: nvm use node

2 - Set up a Github account to use for BV related projects: https://github.com/

3 - Fork the git repository to your profile: https://github.com/adrianhintze/ie-onboarding-mock-implementation

4 - Clone the forked repository to your local machine: https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository

5 - Install project dependencies by running the following command in the repository folder: npm install

6 - Run the server by using the command: npm start

7 - You can now access the site by visiting the following address: http://localhost:8080
