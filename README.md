# Welcome to the TC training mock environment!

Your goal will be to get into our clients shoes and get a full basic BV implementation up and running.

## Before you start

1. Install NVM. Open your command prompt and:
   1. Run the following command: **curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.0/install.sh | bash**
   2. Make sure the installation worked with: **nvm --version**
   3. Install node with: **nvm install node**
   4. Set the current node version to the one you just installed: **nvm use node**

2. Set up a Github account to use for BV related projects (use your BV email address): https://github.com/

3. Fork the git repository to your profile: https://github.com/adrianhintze/ie-onboarding-mock-implementation

4. Clone the forked repository to your local machine: https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository

5. Install project dependencies by running the following command in the repository folder: **npm install**

6. Run the server by using the command: **npm start**

7. You can now access the site by visiting the following address: http://localhost:8080
